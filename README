This codebase creates a reference set from public ClinicalTrials.gov data.
It also has some logic for creating an equivalently formatted set from the OMOP and EU-ADR reference sets.

The following pipeline creates the reference set:
1. download.sh gets all of the clinical trials and finds the ones with outcomes
2. extract_raw.py extracts raw records and maps them to ICD10 and ATC codes.
3. extract_unique.py consolidates the raw records into unique ICD10 and ATC tuples. It also performs statistical calculations.
4. extract_positive_negative.py performs the Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg procedure to identify significant positive and negative controls.
